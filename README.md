## Introduction

Heart disease, including heart attacks, is a leading cause of mortality worldwide. This project focuses on analyzing medical data to understand factors associated with heart attacks. The primary objectives of this analysis include:

- Identifying demographic factors (age, gender, etc.) associated with heart attacks.
- Exploring medical history, lifestyle factors, and other health indicators.
- Examining potential correlations between different variables and heart attack rates.
- Providing insights to aid in understanding and potentially mitigating heart attack risks.

## Data

The dataset used for this analysis contains anonymized medical data, including patient demographics, medical history, lifestyle factors, and heart attack outcomes. Due to privacy concerns, the dataset cannot be shared publicly. However, the analysis code provided in this repository can be adapted to work with similar medical datasets.

## Analysis Overview

The analysis involves the following key steps:

1. Data Preprocessing: Cleaning the data, handling missing values, and ensuring data consistency.
2. Exploratory Data Analysis: Visualizing key features of the dataset to uncover patterns and trends related to heart attacks.
3. Statistical Analysis: Conducting hypothesis tests and correlation analyses to validate findings.
4. Insights and Recommendations: Summarizing key insights and proposing recommendations for further investigation or intervention.

## Folder Structure

- `/data`: Placeholder directory for storing datasets (not included in this repository).
- `/notebooks`: Jupyter notebooks containing the EDA code and analysis results.
- `/images`: Visualizations generated during the analysis.
- `/scripts`: Additional scripts or utilities used in the analysis.
- `README.md`: This file providing an overview of the project.

## Getting Started

To replicate the analysis, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Install the necessary dependencies (see [Dependencies](#dependencies)).
3. Obtain a similar medical dataset containing information relevant to heart attacks and place it in the `/data` directory.
4. Run the Jupyter notebooks in the `/notebooks` directory to execute the analysis.
5. Explore the generated visualizations and insights.

## Dependencies

The analysis code is written in Python and requires the following dependencies:

- `numpy`
- `pandas`
- `matplotlib`
- `seaborn`
- `scipy`

You can install these dependencies using `pip`:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn scipy
